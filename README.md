# Datarock Tennis Match

Coding interview question.
I hope you enjoy evaluating this as much as I enjoyed building it. :)

## Notes

- This code will only run ONLY 1 Set of a Tennis match even though the design permits more Sets.
- Testing is NOT exhaustive. Some tests have deliberately been left out.
- Methods have been designed to prevent mocking and facilitate easier Unit testing.
- 3 methods for calling the tie-breaker scores exists. I have picked the simplest method.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

   ```
   $ npm install
   ```

## Run

1. Edit `index.ts` found in the root to set your desired sequence. An example is provided.

2. Build and Run.

   ```
   $ npm start
   ```

## Test

Testing is done using Jest. Testing is NOT exhaustive. Some tests have deliberately been left out.

```
$ npm run test
```
